# Payment Flow

## Stripe integration
It is crucial for your users and creators to onboard on Stripe to have the possibility to sell their NFT.
Arterra Labs platform provides a binding to the Stripe that will lead your users through this process.

_CREATOR_ users are not allowed to mint any token before they finish the onboarding procedure on Stripe.
It is required to receive money from the initial sale and following royalty transfers after secondary sales.

_FAN_ users can buy any tokens for USD using Stripe binding.
But they need to complete the onboarding procedure before they can sell any NFT they own.
