# Business Partner (BP)

## Create Business Partner

Before creating Business Partner future partner has to create an account on ARterra Labs platform.<br/>
During the process of partner creation this registered user will be assigned to _BP ADMIN_ role.

:::note
By default, right after registration this user has _FAN_ user role.
But no worries, the role is going to be changed during assigning root ADMIN user to your Business Partner.

Then you need to contact ARterra Labs Representative who will create a business partner entity for you
and assign first _BP_ADMIN_ user.<br/>

:::caution
Make sure that your root user has email verified

Further, you can change your branding logo, description and assign more _BP_ADMIN_ users on your own in the Admin Panel.
