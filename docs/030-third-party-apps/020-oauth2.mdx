# OAuth2

ARterra Labs API provides OAuth 2.0 compatible authentication workflow.

OAuth 2.0, is a standard designed to allow applications to access resources hosted by other web apps on behalf of a user.
OAuth 2.0 provides consented access and restricts actions of what the client app can perform on resources on behalf of the user,
without ever sharing the user's credentials.

:::info
Comprehensive information about OAuth 2.0 can be found [here](https://auth0.com/intro-to-iam/what-is-oauth-2/).

For detailed description you can check [RFC 6749](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6749) standard.
:::

Because ARterra Labs API follows RFC it is possible to use any compatible libraries for your programming language, e.g.:
- [Node passport-oauth2](http://www.passportjs.org/packages/passport-oauth2/)
- [JavaScript](https://oauth.net/code/javascript/)
- [NodeJS](https://oauth.net/code/nodejs/)
- [PHP](https://oauth.net/code/php/)
- [Java](https://oauth.net/code/java/)

ARterra Labs OAuth2 implementation includes these grant types:
- `authorization_code` - The ARterra Labs API returns a single-use Authorization Code to the 3rd party application,
which is then exchanged for an Access Token.<br/>
This is the best option for traditional web apps where the exchange can securely happen on the server side.
- `password` - This grant requires the 3rd party app first to acquire the userâ€™s credentials, which are passed to the ARterra Labs server.<br/>
Because users may be afraid of providing their login info (ARterra Labs email/password) on your website domain
it is advised to use `authorization_code` grant type with redirects to ARterra Labs login page. 
- `refresh_token` - exchange of a Refresh Token for a new Access Token without asking a user to authenticate.

:::note
ARterra Labs API has no `scope` related restrictions so receiving `access_token` using OAuth2 flow means that
3rd party application gains full control and can perform any action this user has permission. 
:::

## OAuth2 connect flow

:::caution
Before connecting 3rd party application to ARterra Labs API you must have created Business Partner and user with _BP_ADMIN_ access.

How to configure Business Partner and assign _BP_ADMIN_ user is described in [Business Partner](business-partner) section

![BP w/o credentials](/img/docs/third-party-apps/bp-wo-credentials.png)
:::

Authorize as _BP_ADMIN_ user and create client credentials for your future application.
![BP create credentials](/img/docs/third-party-apps/bp-create-credentials.png)

Client credentials for specified redirect URI should appear in the section below.<br/>
Client ID and Client Secret are generated automatically by the system.<br/>
Client Secret is visible only to _BP_ADMIN_ user, even Platform _ADMIN_ has no access to it.

You can create up to 8 different client credentials.
![BP create credentials](/img/docs/third-party-apps/bp-with-credentials.png)

Now, when you have created client credentials, you can integrate your application (OAuth2 Client) with ARterra Labs API.<br/>
Further you can find instructions which will help you to guide your user through OAuth2 [sign-in](oauth2#oauth2-sign-up-register)
or [sign-up](oauth2#oauth2-sign-up-register) and [example application](oauth2#example-application) with integrations. 

### OAuth2 Sign In (login)
This flow is described in details in [RFC 6749](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6749) standard.

In general, you need to:
1. **Redirect your User to ARterra Labs login page.**

  Sandbox ARterra Labs auth page for OAuth2 flow is https://staging.arterra.co/oauth2-login.<br/>
  For live env - https://app.arterra.co/oauth2-login.<br/>
  :::note
  If OAuth2 link is configured incorrectly user will be redirected to main ARterra Labs page.
  :::

  According to RFC 6749 the OAuth2 link must have these query params:
    - `client_id` - _required_, your Client ID
    - `response_type` - _required_, to open login page it should be equal to `code`
    - `redirect_uri` - _required_, the Redirect URI to return your users back from ARterra Labs auth page.<br/>
      The value must match your application URI registered in Client Credential section of Business Partner Admin page.
    - `state` - _optional_, pass any value to transfer through auth flow,
       e.g. user id or some security token to verify authorization integrity

  E.g. OAuth2 sign in link for the example application _Surf Planet_ that was configured earlier in screenshots will look this way:<br/>
  https://staging.arterra.co/oauth2-login?client_id=client_475ed119&response_type=code&redirect_uri=http://127.0.0.1:3000/api/arterra/login-callback&state=some-state
  ![OAuth2 Sign in](/img/docs/third-party-apps/oauth2-arterra-login-page.png)

2. **User signs-in.**
   
  The user provides his credentials and signs-in to the ARterra Labs Platform.

3. **ARterra Labs redirects user back to redirect URI you provided with authorization code in query param.**

   After successful authentication user is redirected to your application link that you specified in the Redirect URI.

   The link will have these query params:
     - `code` - _required_, the authorization code that you can exchange to access token.<br/>
     This code is valid for one time use during 3 minute.
     - `state` - _optional_, keeps value passed during redirect to ARterra Labs auth page

   :::caution
   It might be that user had no account on ARterra Labs Platform and just have created a new one.
   In that case redirect URI to your application will be different.<br/>
   For details how to handle new ARterra Labs users check [next section](oauth2#oauth2-sign-up-register)
   :::

4. **Your application exchanges authorization code to access token
which you can use for further requests to ARterra Labs API on behalf of the user.**

  ARterra Labs API endpoint to receive access token: https://staging.arterra.co/api/api/#/auth/AuthController_issueAccessToken <br/>
  It is important to pass `Authorization: Basic Base64({CLIENT_ID}:{CLIENT_SECRET})` header
  with Base64 encoded string of your Client ID and Client Secret.<br/>
  For _Surf Planet_ example application it is `Buffer.from('client_475ed119:secret_a5ee033782be4636cbefc8').toString('base64')`
  &#8658; `Y2xpZW50XzQ3NWVkMTE5OnNlY3JldF9hNWVlMDMzNzgyYmU0NjM2Y2JlZmM4`.

5. **Perform any action on behalf of the user using ARterra Labs API**

  With received access token you can perform requests to [ARterra Labs API](https://staging.arterra.co/api/api/).<br/>
  Access token should be passed in `Authorization: Bearer {ACCESS_TOKEN}` header.

### OAuth2 Sign Up (register)
To open sign up page for ARterra Labs OAuth2 we added unofficial query param `response_type=signup`
instead of `response_type=code`.<br/>
All other query params (`client_id`, `redirect_uri`, `state`) are left the same as for sign in flow.

So the OAuth2 sign up page for ARterra Labs will look like:<br/>
https://staging.arterra.co/oauth2-login?client_id=client_475ed119&response_type=signup&redirect_uri=http://127.0.0.1:3000/api/arterra/login-callback&state=some-state

![OAuth2 Sign up](/img/docs/third-party-apps/oauth2-arterra-signup-page.png)

:::tip
We still advise using standard OAuth2 `response_type` query param equal to `code` because in case User has no account
he can still click `Sign Up` button and proceed with registration.<br/>
Also, you will not need to keep track about existence of ARterra Labs account for your users.

![OAuth2 Sign up promt](/img/docs/third-party-apps/oauth2-arterra-login-signup-prompt.png)
:::

In case user had no ARterra Labs account and created a new one he can not sign in until his email got verified.

Then there will be no `code` query param in the redirect to your application.<br/>
When you receive `userId` query param that means that new ARterra Labs user was created
but he needs to check his mailbox and finish email verification.<br/>
For that case we recommend to show user a message to verify his email.

![Email verification prompt](/img/docs/third-party-apps/email-verification-prompt.png)

The link in his mailbox will also return him to your application from where he can retry sign in request.

### Example application
We prepared several JS [examples](https://github.com/ARterraCo/arterra-oauth2-connect-example)
on how to integrate ARterra Labs OAuth2 flow to your application.

- API requests performed with axios without any auth libraries: `src/app-raw-axios-auth.js`
- passport with passport-oauth2 express middlewares: `src/app-passport-oauth2-auth.js`

These examples will show you how to receive `access_token` and use it to fetch private user information and Collectibles.

```shell
# clone git repo
git clone https://github.com/ARterraCo/arterra-oauth2-connect-example.git
cd arterra-oauth2-connect-example

# install dependencies
npm install

# Start application
node src/app-raw-axios-auth.js
# or
npm start
```

Open http://127.0.0.1:3000 to test in browser.

![Example app](/img/docs/third-party-apps/example-app-initial-page.png)

Optionally, you can provide your own Business Partner client credentials:
```shell
vi src/config.js
```

For detailed information how to configure example application
check project [README](https://github.com/ARterraCo/arterra-oauth2-connect-example) file.

### Refresh access token

ARterra Labs API endpoint to refresh access token is the same as for receiving access token:
https://staging.arterra.co/api/api/#/auth/AuthController_issueAccessToken.<br/>
The difference between issuing new access token and refreshing is in `grant_type`.<br/> 

You still must pass `Authorization: Basic Base64({CLIENT_ID}:{CLIENT_SECRET})` header.

<HttpRequestCodeExample request={`
curl -X 'POST' 'https://staging.arterra.co/api/auth/oauth2-token' \\
