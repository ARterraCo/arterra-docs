# Payments

Payment Admin Page allows _ADMINs_ to check payment status for related users.
Platform _ADMIN_ users have access to all payments.<br/>
And _BP_ADMIN_ users can view NFTs that were minted by _CREATOR_ users assigned to that very BP.

Currently, there is no interactive elements to somehow perform any actions. This page leads information purposes only.
